                    <p>The people of Earth have a long history of observing their own planet. The practice of using satellites to observe Earth dates back to 1964 (and perhaps even before then) with Nimbus, a series of missions carried out by NASA.
                        Since then, that number has only continued to grow, and now there are over 150 Earth Observing satellites in orbit. These Earth Observing satellites come not just from NASA, but from countries all across the world, all in an effort to understand our planet better. Enjoy
                        your look into some of the Earth Observing Satellites in orbit today.
